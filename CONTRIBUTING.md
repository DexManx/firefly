# Contributing to INSERTWALLETNAME
We welcome contributions to INSERTWALLETNAME and associated libraries, whether it's a new feature, a bugfix or a change to the documentation. Please do not hesistate to reach out for support.

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). When creating a pull request, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue your pull request
    * All code should follow the [code styleguide](/docs/dev/styleguide.md).
    * A pull request should have exactly one concern (i.e. one feature or one bug). A PR that addresses more than one concern should be split into multiple PRs.

## We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), so commit messages are consistent
Commit messages and branch names should follow a consistent structure (we use [Conventional Commits](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).

1. `fix:` a commit of the type fix patches a bug in the codebase.
2. `feat:` a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase.
3. types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, `chore:`, `ci:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, and others.
4. branch names should follow a similar pattern e.g. `feat/new-feature`, `chore/update-docs` etc.

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache License 2.0
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/iotaledger/new-wallet/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact us if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/iotaledger/new-wallet/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. To report a bug, [open a new issue](https://github.com/iotaledger/new-wallet/issues/new?labels=T+-+Bug&template=bug_report.md&title=), and be sure to include as many details as possible, using the template.

- **Do not open a GitHub issue for [security vulnerabilities](SECURITY.MD)**, instead, please submit a report to our [Bugcrowd program](https://bugcrowd.com/iota).
- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching the [**Issues**](https://github.com/iotaledger/new-wallet/issues). 
    * If **there is an open issue**, add a comment instead of opening a new issue. If you find a similar **Closed** issue, open a new issue and include a link to the original one.

## Suggest features using Github's [issues](https://github.com/iotaledger/new-wallet/issues)

To suggest a new feature, talk to the IOTA community and IOTA Foundation members in the #INSERTWALLETNAME-discussion channel on [Discord](https://discord.iota.org/).
- **Ensure the feature has not already been suggested** by searching the [**Issues**](https://github.com/iotaledger/new-wallet/issues).
- If the wallet team approves your feature, the team will create an issue for it.
